# StarDust
I noticed that there were very few night themes in SiYuan Note, and the few that were there were basically just black and grey interface colours. I thought to myself, "It's too homogeneous, it's not interesting." This gave me the idea to make a theme that would give a cosmic, starry sky feel. So I made StarDust and modified a lot of parts of the software without adding any special features, in order to give the user a different note taking experience.<br>

### Hyperlinks, block references, superblocks
As the default purple does not stand out well on a dark background, modify the block reference colour to green. Surrounded by fluorescent light. Superblock sets the card style.
